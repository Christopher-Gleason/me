    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img src="images/house.jpg" alt="House">
        <p> Staying home is an impassable choice when the opportunity arrise.I would definitely
            consider myself an independent worker, one of those students who often does group
            projects alone. I can always work with people if I need to, but I would rather do
            things my own way without conflictions or debates.
        </p>
    <h1></h1>
        <img src="images/game_controller.jpg" alt="Game Controller">
        <p>Most of my time is spent alone, usually on the internet or plyaing video games.
        I prefer PC games over console games, but I do use a controller in some circumstances.
